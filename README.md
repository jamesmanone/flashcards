# Flashcards
## Introduction
Flashcards is a cross platform mobile app that takes all the complexity of pens and index cards out of flashcard-style studying. Out of ink? Don't like killing trees to sharpen your mind? Try Flashcards today!
## Tech Stack
Flashcards is built on the React Native/Redux/Expo stack. This is the third project for Udacity's React Nanodegree.
## Installation
To install Flashcards, start by cloning the repo and installing dependencies.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jamesmanone/flashcards.git
$ cd flashcards
$ yarn install  # npm can be substituted for yarn
```
If you don't have an iOS or android simulator you must install expo on your mobile device. Search for it in the app store or on Google play.
## Run
```bash
$ yarn start  # again, npm start can be used here as well
```
Follow the instuctions in your terminal window to start on iOS or android simulators, or launch in expo on your mobile device.
